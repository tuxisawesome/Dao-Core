# Dao-Core
### A application programming interface that (theoretically) allows Python programs to be truely cross-platform

To start, execute

`$ ./main.py`: Unix/Linux

`python3 main.py`: Cross-platform

Copy the contents of "coreos" to any micropython-enabled platform.

This true cross-compatibility allows me to test web server changes without having to re-deploy my changes onto my microcontroller every time.
